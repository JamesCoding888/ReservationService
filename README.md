- Description:  


                This is a Java program that uses the Selenium WebDriver library to automate a task on a web page.
                
                #1 code snippet:
		
                      Note that #1 code snippet only checks the button's status once. If you want to continuously check the button's status until it 
                      
                      becomes enabled, you will need to use a loop that repeatedly checks the button's status and waits a certain amount of time between 
                      
                      each check.  

                #2 code snippet:

                      The #2 code snippet we use a loop and wait for a certain amount of time before checking again. 	

                      Also, we do refresh the web-page with the driver.navigate().refresh() method, which will reload the current page.		

                      Overall, the #2 example will keep refreshing the page and checking the status of the button until it is enabled. 

                      Once it is enabled, the loop will break and you can click the button.
